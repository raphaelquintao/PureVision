# PureVision GTK Theme

My personal GTK theme inspired by the legendary Arc theme. (But with less drama)

Ps.: This code is so old, it probably remembers dial-up. I really should update it sometime...

I tried every other theme, but nothing else felt right. So here we are.

## Why PureVision?
- Less accent color! Your text area will NEVER randomly turn blue at 2am. (Seriously, who likes that?)
- More neutral tones. Because not everything needs to scream for attention.
- Dark mode that doesn't hurt your eyes.
- Rounded corners. Because sharp edges are so last century.
- Thoughtful details. Like hover effects that actually make sense.


## Build Requirements
- inkscape (for SVG wizardry)
- sassc (for stylish styles)
- Probably others stuffs, because nothing is ever simple...

## Build and Install
`make all` 
'cp /build/PureVision* ~/.themes/'
