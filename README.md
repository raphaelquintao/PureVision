# PureVision GTK Theme

My personal GTK theme based on the legendary Arc theme. (But with less drama)

This code is so old, it probably remembers dial-up. I really should update it sometime...

I tried every other theme, but nothing else felt right. So here we are.

## Why PureVision?
- Less accent color! Your text area will NEVER randomly turn blue at 2am. (Seriously, who likes that?)
- More neutral tones. Because not everything needs to scream for attention.
- Dark mode that doesn't hurt your eyes.


## Build Requirements
- inkscape (for SVG wizardry)
- sassc (for stylish styles)
- Probably others stuffs, because nothing is ever simple...

## Build and Install
- `make all` 
- `cp -r build/PureVision* ~/.themes/`
